### What is c3status ?

c3status is a simple status bar for i3wm written in C.
The main goal of c3status is to be simple to understand and easily extensible by writting functions and recompile the code.

c3status is probably useless without slight modifications for now because it was originally written for my personal use only and is absolutely not optimized, but now it's "just working" i'll continue to work on it to make it better.

### Why is c3status even existing ? There are a lot of status bar available !

Initially, i wanted more infos on my status bar than i3status could provide, as it is not very extensible, so i searched for other status bar but i decided to write my own, just for fun !

### Can i take your code and adapt it for me ?

Of course, that is the goal !
c3status is under no licence so you can do everything you want with the code !
