<h1 id="c3status">c3status</h1>
<p>c3status is a simple status bar for i3wm written in C.</p>
<p>The main goal of c3status is to be simple to understand and easily extensible by writing functions and recompile the code, which allow you to display almost anything in your status bar.<br />c3status is designed to be as lightweight as possible by using system calls and by getting info at a low level without needing to run shell commands.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-build-install-and-use-c3status">How to build, install and use c3status</h2>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<p>To build c3status you will need to install a few dependencies which are Alsa and Wireless-tools development files.<br />Under Debian 8 &quot;Jessie&quot; you can have those by installing the following packages:</p>
<pre><code>libasound2-dev
libiw-dev</code></pre>
<p>You can install those with:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install libasound2-dev libiw-dev</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, if you want to rebuild the man page of c3status, you will need those packages:</p>
<pre><code>asciidoc
libxml2-utils
docbook-xml
xsltproc</code></pre>
<p>Note that you should use <code>apt-get install --no-install-recommends</code> for installing the asciidoc as apt-get will try to install a <strong>lot</strong> of recommended yet useless packages.<br />Those packages should be available under any Linux distribution, though their names may vary.</p>
<p>If you want to rebuild the documentation (for now it is only a HTML version of the present README), you will need the <code>pandoc</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="building-and-installing">Building and installing</h3>
<p>Installing c3status is quite easy:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone &quot;https://github.com/Sudiukil/c3status&quot;
$ cd c3status
# make install</code></pre>
<p>Then you need to modify the <em>status_command</em> line in you i3wm config file to use c3status:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>status_command c3status</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also specify an update interval in seconds (default is 1) with the '-t' option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>status_command c3status -t 5</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-configure-c3status">How to configure c3status</h2>
<p>To change what is displayed by c3status you need to edit a <strong>config.h</strong> file.</p>
<p>Provided <strong>config.example.h</strong> displays a few informations on the status bar and quickly explains how to write your <strong>config.h</strong>.<br />You can also see the man page for more info about the way to configure c3status.</p>
